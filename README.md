Keeping up with

* HTTP/2

* HTTPS and HTTP in coexistence or redirecting

* Let's encrypt certification

* Localhost certificate based on [Filipo Valsordas tool](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert)

* Content Security Policies - CSP  
  against CSRF

* Compress static content  
  on the fly - or precompress on app start

* PWA service worker and manifest

* PWA compatible HTML template

Trying to combine it into a slim `go` program,  
which is testable using [Google Lighthouse](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/Lighthouse).
